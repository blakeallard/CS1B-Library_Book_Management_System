This program allows the user to input information about multiple books, such as the title, author, and publishing year, and then displays the entered details. It demonstrates the use of dynamic memory allocation for storing multiple book objects and functions for setting and displaying book information.

Key Features:
Dynamic Array of Books: The program uses dynamic memory allocation (new) to create an array of Book objects based on user input.

Input Handling: The user is prompted to input the title, author, and publishing year for each book.

Book Class Functions: The Book class includes methods for setting book information and displaying it in a formatted output.

Multiple Books Handling: The program handles multiple books using a loop and stores the information for each book separately.

Memory Management: Proper use of dynamic memory allocation for handling an array of objects and ensuring efficient memory usage.

Skills Demonstrated:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Using new to dynamically create an array of Book objects.

Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing a class (Book) with methods to set and display book details.

String Handling: Using getline to handle multi-word book titles and authors.

Loops: Using loops to iterate over an array of book objects to input and display data.

Files Included:
main.cpp – Contains the main logic for creating and managing book objects.

Book.h – Header file for the Book class, containing the class definition and method declarations.

Book.cpp – Defines the methods of the Book class, including the constructor and functions to set and display book details.
